“VitaPets” PRIVACY POLICY
Effective Date: September 22, 2025

1.Our Commitment to Your Privacy
Welcome to "VitaPets," a product by GestionaiA. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our application. Our foundational principle is privacy by design, which means the application was built from the ground up with the goal of protecting your information and your pet's information.
This policy is designed to be as clear and straightforward as possible. We ask that you read it carefully to understand what data we handle and, more importantly, what data we do not.

2.The Information We Handle
It is crucial to distinguish between the data you manage on your device and the minimal information we need for your account to function.
A. Information YOU Store Locally (Data We CANNOT Access):
The primary function of "VitaPets" is to be a local information manager. All sensitive information about your pets that you enter into the application is stored in an encrypted format exclusively on your mobile device.
We DO NOT collect, view, or have access to:
•The names or photos of your pets.
•Their medical history, vaccinations, or treatments.
•Your veterinarian's contact details.
•Any other notes or documents you save in the app.
This information remains under your complete and total control. If you uninstall the application, this data will be deleted from your device (unless you have made a backup on your own).
B. Information We DO Collect for Your Account to Function:
To create your account, protect it, and allow you to recover it, we collect the following minimal personal information:
•Email Address: We use this as your unique user ID and to communicate with you about important matters regarding your account (such as password recovery).
•Password: We require this to protect your account. Your password is a always stored using strong hashing techniques, which means that even we cannot see your actual password.

•To Provide Technical Support: To be able to assist you if you encounter problems with your account.

4.How We Share Your Information? The Simple Answer: We Don't
Your trust is our most important asset. Therefore:
•We DO NOT sell, rent, or share your personal information (email address) with third-party companies for their marketing purposes.
•We will only disclose your information if we are legally compelled to do so by a court order or valid governmental request.

5.Data Security
We take the security of your account information very seriously. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including:
•Encryption in Transit: All communication between the application and our servers is carried out over secure protocols (HTTPS).
•Secure Storage: Passwords are stored in a hashed format so they cannot be read.
•Limited Access: Only authorized personnel have access to the systems where account information is stored, and only for the purposes described in this policy.

6.Your Rights and Control Over Your Information
We believe you should have control over your data. You have the following rights:
•Right to Access and Rectification: You can view and update your email address directly from your account settings within the application.
